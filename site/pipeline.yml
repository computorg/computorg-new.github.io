    Reservoir Computing (RC) is a machine learning method
        based on neural networks that efficiently process information
        generated by dynamical systems. It has been successful in solving
        various tasks including time series forecasting, language processing
        or voice processing. RC is implemented in `Python` and `Julia` but
        not in `R`. This article introduces `reservoirnet`, an `R` package
        providing access to the `Python` API `ReservoirPy`, allowing `R`
        users to harness the power of reservoir computing. This article
        provides an introduction to the fundamentals of RC and showcases its
        real-world applicability through three distinct sections. First, we
        cover the foundational concepts of RC, setting the stage for
        understanding its capabilities. Next, we delve into the practical
        usage of `reservoirnet` through two illustrative examples. These
        examples demonstrate how it can be applied to real-world problems,
        specifically, regression of COVID-19 hospitalizations and
        classification of Japanese vowels. Finally, we present a
        comprehensive analysis of a real-world application of
        `reservoirnet`, where it was used to forecast COVID-19
        hospitalizations at Bordeaux University Hospital using public data
        and electronic health records.
