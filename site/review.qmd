Computo relies on <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=Computo">Open Review</a>
for the review process. The review form is text-based, but Markdown and LaTeX formatting is supported so you can add hyperlinks and use LaTeX to add equations to your review. Reviewers are also required to answer a handful  of rating  scale questions  about the  submission.
    </p>
<p>Once a manuscript  is accepted, reviews and discussion will be made available
on the Computo website. Reviewers  can choose to remain anonymous or
not.</p>
