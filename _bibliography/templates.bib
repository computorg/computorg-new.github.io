                  contributions to the Computo Journal. We show how R
                  or Python code can be included. It also serves as a
                  documentation for configuring the github repository
                  which will host the Rmarkdown source of your
                  manuscript and prove us the reproducibility of your
                  work. To this end, we use binder to generate the
                  final rendering of your manuscript both in HTML and
                  PDF.},
