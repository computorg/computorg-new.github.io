  abstract =     {Deep learning is used in computer vision problems with
                  important applications in several scientific
                  fields. In ecology for example, there is a growing
                  interest in deep learning for automatizing
                  repetitive analyses on large amounts of images, such
                  as animal species identification.  However, there
                  are challenging issues toward the wide adoption of
                  deep learning by the community of ecologists. First,
                  there is a programming barrier as most algorithms
                  are written in Python while most ecologists are
                  versed in R. Second, recent applications of deep
                  learning in ecology have focused on computational
                  aspects and simple tasks without addressing the
                  underlying ecological questions or carrying out the
                  statistical data analysis to answer these questions.
                  Here, we showcase a reproducible R workflow
                  integrating both deep learning and statistical
                  models using predator-prey relationships as a case
                  study. We illustrate deep learning for the
                  identification of animal species on images collected
                  with camera traps, and quantify spatial
                  co-occurrence using multispecies occupancy models.
                  Despite average model classification performances,
                  ecological inference was similar whether we analysed
                  the ground truth dataset or the classified
                  dataset. This result calls for further work on the
                  trade-offs between time and resources allocated to
                  train models with deep learning and our ability to
                  properly address key ecological questions with
                  biodiversity monitoring. We hope that our
                  reproducible workflow will be useful to ecologists
                  and applied statisticians.},
