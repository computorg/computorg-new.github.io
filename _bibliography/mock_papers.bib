  abstract =     {We present a new technique called “t-SNE” that
                  visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each
                  datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional
                  map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic
                  Neighbor Embedding hinton:stochastic that is much
                  easier to optimize, and produces significantly
                  better visualizations by reducing the tendency to
                  crowd points together in the center of the
                  map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at
                  creating a single map that reveals structure at many
                  different scales. This is particularly important for
                  high-dimensional data that lie on several different,
                  but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as
                  images of objects from multiple classes seen from
                  multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure
                  of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use
                  random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the
                  implicit structure of all the data to influence the
                  way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We
                  illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide
                  variety of data sets and compare it with many other
                  non-parametric visualization techniques, including
                  Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear
                  Embedding. The visualization produced by t-SNE are
                  significantly better than those produced by other
                  techniques on almost all of the data sets.},
