This year, you have the opportunity to express your interest in publishing in Computo an extended version of your submission to the [2025 French Statistics Days](https://jds2025.sciencesconf.org/), by selecting the theme “Interest in Computo submission” when you submit on [SciencesConf](https://jds2025.sciencesconf.org/submission/submit?lang=fr). If the conference program committee considers that your work falls within the scope of our journal, you will be invited to propose a longer version of your submission to Computo. We (the editorial board and technical team) will be able to assist you in bringing your article into the journal's reproducible format, targeting the end of June 2025. The review process will then involve experts in the field, following the recommendations of the conference program committee, with a view to publication in Computo by the end of 2025.
