This year, Computo will publish extended versions of selected submissions to [2025 French Statistics Days](https://jds2025.sciencesconf.org/). If interested, please select the theme “Interest in Computo submission” in your [SciencesConf](https://jds2025.sciencesconf.org/submission/submit?lang=fr) submission. If the conference program committee considers that your work falls within the scope of our journal, you will be invited to propose a longer version of your submission to Computo. We (the editorial board and technical team) will be able to assist you in bringing your article into the journal's reproducible format, targeting the end of June 2025. The review process will then involve experts in the field, following the recommendations of the conference program committee, with a view to publication in Computo by the end of 2025.
